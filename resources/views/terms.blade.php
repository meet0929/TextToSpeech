<p class="mb-4">In the European Union (EU), TextToSpeech' liability for damages caused by deliberate intention or gross negligence is unrestricted.</p>
<p class="mb-4">However, in cases of slight negligence, TextToSpeech is only liable if it has breached a fundamental duty that jeopardizes the purpose of the contract or if it has breached duties necessary for the proper implementation of the contract, and you generally rely on the fulfillment of these duties. In such cases, TextToSpeech is liable only for typical, foreseeable damages at the time the respective Service was performed.</p>
<p class="mb-4">TextToSpeech will not be liable for failure to perform duties due to events beyond its reasonable control, such as acts of God, acts of terrorism, civil unrest, war, fires, power cuts, or epidemics. Additionally, initial defects without fault are not covered under liability.</p>
<p class="mb-4">If TextToSpeech is not liable or its liability is restricted, this limitation also applies to the personal liability of its employees, legal representatives, and assistants in performance.</p>
<p class="mb-4">However, the restrictions of liability do not apply to cases of damages to life, body, or health, to cases of product warranty, and to cases of fraudulent concealment of defects.</p>
<p class="mb-4">TextToSpeech is liable for the loss of data only up to the amount that would have been incurred to restore the data if it had been properly and regularly backed up.</p>
<p class="mb-4">For users of free plans, TextToSpeech is not obligated to remedy defects in the Service. If harm is suffered from a defect, TextToSpeech is only liable if the defect was willfully concealed. Otherwise, liability is limited to intention and gross negligence.</p>

<h2 class="f24">Settling disputes, governing law, and courts - US Specific:</h2>
<h2 class="f20">Generally:</h2>
<p class="mb-4">Except as outlined in the sections below titled "Exceptions" and "Opt-Out," both you and TextToSpeech agree that any dispute arising concerning these Terms of Service, the Services, or communications from us will be settled through binding arbitration. Arbitration utilizes a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less formal than a court proceeding, may involve more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to resolve disputes through arbitration encompasses all claims, whether grounded in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and irrespective of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms of Service. Any dispute regarding the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="mb-4">YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, BOTH YOU AND TextToSpeech ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
<h2 class="f20">Exceptions:</h2>
<p class="mb-4">While we are committing to arbitrate most disputes between us, these Terms of Service do not waive, preclude, or otherwise restrict the right of either party to: (a) initiate an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the relevant federal, state, or local agency if such action is available; (c) request injunctive relief in a court of law to support arbitration; or (d) file a lawsuit in a court of law to address a claim of intellectual property infringement.</p>
<h2 class="f20">Opt-Out:</h2>
<p class="mb-4">If you prefer not to resolve disputes through binding arbitration, you have the option to opt out of the provisions outlined in the "Dispute Resolution and Arbitration" section (the "Arbitration Clause") within 30 days after agreeing to these Terms of Service. To opt out, please send a letter to Eleven Labs Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 169 Madison Ave #2484, New York, NY 10016. The letter should include your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement expressing your desire to opt out of arbitration ("Opt-Out Notice"). Upon receipt of your Opt-Out Notice, TextToSpeech will nullify the Arbitration Clause, and any disputes arising from these Terms of Service will be resolved according to the procedures outlined in the section titled "Governing Law" below. Your decision to opt out will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service.</p>
<h2 class="f20">Arbitrator:</h2>
<p class="mb-4">This arbitration agreement and any arbitration proceedings between us are governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and will be overseen by JAMS (Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services) under the rules that apply to consumer disputes ("JAMS Rules"), as adjusted by the terms set forth in these Terms of Service. The JAMS Rules and the necessary filing forms can be accessed online at <a href="www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a>, or you can contact JAMS directly by calling +1-800-352-5267. Alternatively, you may reach out to TextToSpeech for assistance in obtaining this information.</p>
<h2 class="f20">Commencing Arbitration:</h2>
<p class="mb-4">Prior to initiating arbitration, one party must send a written notice of the dispute to the other party via certified U.S. Mail, Federal Express (with signature required), or, if the other party has not provided a current physical address, by electronic mail ("Notice of Arbitration"). The address for providing Notice to TextToSpeech is: Eleven Labs Inc., 169 Madison Ave #2484, New York, NY 10016. The Notice of Arbitration should: (a) specify the name or account number of the party initiating the claim; (b) outline the nature and grounds of the claim or dispute; and (c) detail the specific relief sought ("Demand"). Both parties will endeavor in good faith to resolve the claim directly. However, if no agreement is reached within 30 days following receipt of the Notice of Arbitration, either you or TextToSpeech may proceed with initiating an arbitration proceeding.</p>
<p class="mb-4">If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, TextToSpeech will reimburse you for the filing fee, unless your claim exceeds US$10,000 or TextToSpeech has received 25 or more similar arbitration demands, in which case the payment of fees will be determined by the JAMS Rules. In the event the arbitrator determines that either the substance of the claim or the relief requested in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as defined by the standards outlined in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules, and the opposing party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to JAMS.</p>

<h2 class="f20">Arbitration Proceedings:</h2>
<p class="mb-4">Any arbitration hearing will be held in the county and state where you reside, unless otherwise agreed upon by both parties. Alternatively, if the claim does not exceed US$10,000 (and does not seek injunctive relief), you may opt for the arbitration to be conducted in one of the following ways: (a) based solely on documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) via telephonic or video hearing; or (c) through an in-person hearing as determined by the JAMS Rules in the county (or parish) where you reside.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Throughout the arbitration process, any settlement offers made by either party must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after a final decision and award, if any, has been made. Regardless of the method of arbitration chosen, the arbitrator is required to issue a reasoned written decision, detailing the essential findings and conclusions upon which the decision and award, if any, are based.</p>

<h2 class="f20">Arbitration Relief:</h2>
<p class="mb-4">Subject to the section titled "No Class Actions," the arbitrator has the authority to grant any relief that would be available if the claims were brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards you an amount greater than the last written settlement offer made by TextToSpeech before the arbitrator was selected, TextToSpeech will pay you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, and (b) US$10,000. The arbitrator's decision is final and binding on all parties, except (1) for judicial review permitted by law, or (2) if the arbitrator's award includes injunctive relief against a party. In such cases, the affected party may seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction, which is not bound by the arbitrator's legal conclusions. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.</p>

<h2 class="f20">No Class Actions:</h2>
<p class="mb-4">You and TextToSpeech mutually agree that each may only bring claims against the other in an individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Additionally, unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.</p>
<h2 class="f20">Modifications to this Arbitration Provision:</h2>
<p class="mb-4">If TextToSpeech implements any substantive change to this arbitration provision, you have the option to reject the change by sending written notice to TextToSpeech within 30 days of the change being implemented. If you reject the change, your account with TextToSpeech will be terminated immediately, and the arbitration provision, as it existed prior to the rejected changes, will remain in effect.</p>

<h2 class="f20">Enforceability:</h2>
<p class="mb-4">If the section above titled “No Class Actions” or the entirety of this Arbitration Clause is deemed unenforceable, or if TextToSpeech receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entire Arbitration Clause will be rendered null and void. In such a case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in the section below titled “Governing Law” will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.</p>

<h2 class="f20">Governing Law:</h2>
<p class="mb-4">These Terms of Service are governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law principles. Both you and TextToSpeech agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Manhattan, New York for the resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under these Terms of Service.</p>

<h2 class="f20">EU Specific:</h2>
<p class="mb-4">If you are a resident of, or an Organization based in, the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, these terms and your relationship with TextToSpeech under these terms and Service-specific additional terms are governed by the laws of your country of residence. You have the right to file legal disputes in your local courts. If you are an EEA-based Consumer, please contact us directly to resolve any issues.</p>
<p class="mb-4">The European Commission offers a platform for online dispute resolution, accessible at <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/Consumers/odr/">http://ec.europa.eu/Consumers/odr/</a>. While we are not obligated to participate in alternative dispute resolutions before a Consumer dispute settlement commission, we may choose to do so voluntarily.</p>

<h2 class="f20">UK Specific:</h2>
<p class="mb-4">If you are a resident of, or an Organization based in, the United Kingdom, these terms and your relationship with TextToSpeech under these terms and Service-specific additional terms are governed by English law. You have the right to file legal disputes in the English courts.</p>
<p class="mb-4">The parties waive any right to assert any claims against the other party as a representative or member in any class or representative action, except where such waiver is prohibited by law or deemed by a court of law to be against public policy.</p>
<h2 class="f24">EEA Instructions on Withdrawal:</h2>
<p>You have the right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without giving any reason. The withdrawal period will expire 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract. To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us at:</p>
<p><strong>TextToSpeech.ai</strong><br>
Email: <a href="mailto:support@texttospeech.ai">support@texttospeech.ai</a></p>
<p>of your decision to withdraw from this contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g., a letter sent by post or e-mail). You may use the attached model withdrawal form [<a href="#">add link to form below</a>], but it is not obligatory.</p>
<p class="mb-4">To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.</p>

<h2 class="f20">Effects of Withdrawal:</h2>
<p>If you withdraw from this contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>
<p>If you requested to begin the performance of Services during the withdrawal period, you shall pay us an amount which is in proportion to what has been provided until you have communicated to us your withdrawal from this contract, in comparison with the full coverage of the contract.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Your right to withdraw from this Agreement expires prematurely if the Services were initiated by us to you only after you as a Consumer have expressly agreed that we shall commence with the execution of the contract before the expiry of the withdrawal period, and at the same time have confirmed your knowledge of the fact that you lose your right to withdraw from the contract with the beginning of the execution of the contract.</p>                   
<h2 class="f24">Changes to Terms of Service</h2>
<p class="mb-4">We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Service at our discretion. It is advisable to review these Terms periodically for any updates. Revisions will take effect immediately, unless otherwise stated. For existing users, significant revisions will become effective 30 days after they are posted or you are notified of the changes, unless otherwise specified. Continued use of the Services after such revisions constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms of Service. If you do not agree with the modifications, you should cease using the Services. Any amendments to these Terms of Service require written agreement signed by authorized representatives of both parties, except as expressly permitted in this section.
</p>
<h2 class="f24">General Terms</h2>
<p>These Terms of Service, along with the Privacy Policy and any Service-specific addenda you agree to, constitute the complete and exclusive agreement between you and TextToSpeech regarding the use of the Services. However, if you have a separate agreement with TextToSpeech specifically outlining the provision of Services, that agreement will take precedence over these Terms of Service.</p>
<p>In case of any conflict between the terms of a Service-specific addendum and these Terms of Service, the terms of the addendum will prevail concerning your access and use of that particular Service. You are not permitted to assign or transfer these Terms of Service, or any rights under them, without our prior written consent. However, we reserve the right to assign these Terms of Service and all rights without notice or consent.</p>
<p class="mb-4">The failure to enforce any provision will not waive our right to enforce it later, nor will it waive any subsequent breach or default. The term "including" used throughout these Terms of Service implies "including but not limited to." If any part of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be enforced to the fullest extent possible, while the remaining parts will remain valid and enforceable.</p>
